Paper published in Water Resources Research (WRR) at the American Geophysical Union (AGU). Abstract: Groundwater ages provides insight into recharge rates, flow velocities, and vulnerability to contaminants. The ability to predict groundwater ages based on more accessible parameters via Machine Learning (ML) would advance our ability to guide sustainable management of groundwater resources. In this study, ML models were trained and tested on a large dataset of tritium concentrations (n=2410) and tritium-helium groundwater ages (n=1157) from the California Central Valley, a large groundwater basin with complex land use, irrigation, and water management practices. The ML models were trained on 63 features, including location, well construction information, landscape characteristics, and climate variables, water chemistry, and stable isotopes. The Bagging Regressor ML method can accurately classify (F1-score = 0.91) groundwater samples as either modern or pre-modern whereas the accuracy of the ML prediction of continuous tritium-helium groundwater ages is limited and explains only ~30% of the variability in this dataset. In general, ML groundwater age prediction relies mostly on features related to (1) the source of groundwater recharge, (2) contaminant history, (3) aquifer materials, (4) well construction, and (5) geochemical reactions along flow paths.\n","permalink":"https://azhara001.github.io/publications-and-preprints/ground-water-predictions/","summary":"Keywords - Machine Learning, Decision Trees, BAGGING, RandomForests, Boosting, Ensemble Learning, Partial Dependence Plots, Feature Importance Plots","title":"Machine Learning Prediction of Tritium-Helium Groundwater Ages in the Central Valley, California, USA"},{"content":" [ Preprint, Poster, Github ] 🗄️📊 Dataset: MPII - 1463 images with an 80/20 training/validation split 🤖 Model: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-Training for Unified Vision-Language Understanding and Generation (BLIP) 🤗: Source Code 📉 Training Loss: Language Modelling Loss from Text Decoder 📏 Evaluation Metric: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) [PyTorch] ⚖️ Validation Threshold Range: [1, 5, 25] pixels ⚙️ Hyperparameter choice: Batch size: 4 Learning Rate: 2e-5 Optimizer: AdamW 🎯 Validation Accuracy of 92.5% with a threshold of 25 pixels ","permalink":"https://azhara001.github.io/projects/fine-tuning-blip/","summary":"Keywords - Deep Learning, BLIP, Vision Transformer (ViT), Fine-Tuning, Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP), PyTorch, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Causal Language Modelling, Self-Attention","title":"Fine-tuning Vision Transformer-Based Model for Pose-Estimation"},{"content":" Canonical Basis (EigenFaces)\n[ Github]\n📝 Description: The \"Facial Recognition using Fisher Faces vs Eigen Faces with Support Vector Machines\" project aimed to develop a robust face recognition algorithm leveraging supervised learning techniques. Two feature extraction methods were explored: Eigenfaces and Fisherfaces. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were then trained using these features to classify faces accurately.\n🖼️ Datasets Used: Olivetti Dataset: 400 images, 40 classes, 4096 features per image. Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW) Dataset: 1850 images, user-defined classes, 62500 features per image. Labelled Faces in the Wild (unprocessed) Dataset: 62500 features per image. 🛠️ Methodology: Feature Extraction: Eigenfaces: Utilized PCA to extract eigenfaces from the image datasets. Fisherfaces: Implemented Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) to extract discriminant features. Classification: SVMs with Linear and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels were trained using the extracted features. Evaluation: The performance of classifiers was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques such as t-SNE visualization were employed to analyze dataset distributions. 🔑 Key Findings: Eigenfaces vs Fisherfaces: Fisherfaces showed improved classification performance compared to Eigenfaces, especially for complex datasets. SVM Kernel Comparison: Linear SVMs outperformed non-linear (RBF) SVMs for most datasets. Dataset Complexity: Performance varied based on dataset complexity, with higher accuracy achieved on simpler datasets. Impact of Dimensionality Reduction: Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA significantly influenced classifier performance. 🏁 Conclusion: The project demonstrated the efficacy of Fisherfaces combined with SVMs for face recognition tasks. By comparing different feature extraction methods and SVM configurations, valuable insights were gained into the nuances of facial recognition systems. The findings contribute to the ongoing research in computer vision and pattern recognition domains, paving the way for more accurate and efficient face recognition algorithms.\n","permalink":"https://azhara001.github.io/projects/facial-recognition/","summary":"Keywords - Support Vector Machines, Principal Component Analysis, Eigen Faces, Fisher Faces, Linear Discriminant Analysis","title":"Facial Recognition using eigenfaces/fisherfaces using an SVM Classifier"},{"content":" Spatio-temporal Heat Map\n[ Article, Poster, Github, Conference Presentation ] 📝 Description: This project delved into the intricate relationship between school closures, traffic congestion, and smog in Lahore, Pakistan. As part of the Smart Data Systems and Applications (SDSA) team at Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), we aimed to leverage data-driven analysis to understand the effectiveness of closing schools on Mondays in reducing traffic congestion and ultimately alleviating smog.\n🎯 Objectives: Investigate the impact of school closure policies on traffic congestion levels in Lahore. Analyze the correlation between traffic congestion reduction and improvements in air quality, particularly regarding smog levels. Provide insights and recommendations based on data-driven findings to inform future policy decisions and urban planning initiatives. 🛠️ Methodology: Utilized the Google Maps Platform to extract data on travel times, routes, and congestion levels in Lahore. Conducted data preprocessing, including normalization of travel times and comparison of velocities to assess traffic congestion. Employed statistical analysis techniques to interpret the impact of school closures on traffic congestion before and during the winter break. Visualized findings through graphs, heatmaps, and geospatial mapping to facilitate understanding and communication of results. 🔍 Results: Identified a significant decrease in traffic congestion on Mondays, particularly during the winter break when schools were closed. Observed a correlation between reduced traffic congestion and improvements in air quality, indicating the potential effectiveness of school closure policies in mitigating smog. Highlighted Thursdays as a day with the greatest decrease in congestion, suggesting alternative strategies beyond Mondays for reducing traffic congestion and smog. 🏁 Conclusion: This project sheds light on the efficacy of school closure policies in addressing traffic congestion and smog in Lahore. By providing actionable insights derived from data analysis, we intended to inform policymakers, urban planners, and stakeholders about effective strategies for mitigating the impact of smog in the region. Our findings underscored the importance of proactive measures and evidence-based decision-making in tackling environmental challenges like smog.\n","permalink":"https://azhara001.github.io/projects/travel-times-analysis/","summary":"Exploring the bittersweet relationship of schools’ closure and smog – an effective step in alleviating traffic congestions?","title":"Analyzing Spatio-Temporal Travel Times using Crowd-sourced Data"},{"content":" 📚 Coursework: 1.
