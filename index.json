[{"content":"Work performed as a Computing Scholar Intern at Lawrence Livermore National Lab.\nMachine Learning Prediction of Tritium-Helium Groundwater Ages in the Central Valley, California, USA Abstract: Groundwater ages provides insight into recharge rates, flow velocities, and vulnerability to contaminants. The ability to predict groundwater ages based on more accessible parameters via Machine Learning (ML) would advance our ability to guide sustainable management of groundwater resources. In this study, ML models were trained and tested on a large dataset of tritium concentrations ($n=2410$) and tritium-helium groundwater ages ($n=1157$) from the California Central Valley, a large groundwater basin with complex land use, irrigation, and water management practices. The ML models were trained on $63$ features, including location, well construction information, landscape characteristics, and climate variables, water chemistry, and stable isotopes. The Bagging Regressor ML method can accurately classify (F1-score = $0.91$) groundwater samples as either modern or pre-modern whereas the accuracy of the ML prediction of continuous tritium-helium groundwater ages is limited and explains only $\\sim 30%$ of the variability in this dataset. In general, ML groundwater age prediction relies mostly on features related to (1) the source of groundwater recharge, (2) contaminant history, (3) aquifer materials, (4) well construction, and (5) geochemical reactions along flow paths.

Pose Estimation refers to the problem of localizing specific body parts in images and videos and encoding the spatial information into a caption relating human skeletal joints with pixel coordinates. While Pose Estimation models have largely been Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based, the advent of Vision Transformers (ViT) has opened new areas of research. In this study, we fine-tune a transformer-based model, BLIP, to generate accurate positional captions and explore attention mechanisms under this task. Starting with a low-complexity version of our problem, we scaled up to our task of fine-tuning BLIP for Pose Estimation. After fine-tuning BLIP on varying hyperparameters, we found that the model consistently performed well during tuning. Within a restricted threshold of 1 pixel, it retained an 81% validation accuracy and an average error of about 4 pixels.
