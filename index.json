The ability to predict groundwater ages based on more accessible parameters via Machine Learning (ML) would advance our ability to guide sustainable management of groundwater resources. In this study, ML models were trained and tested on a large dataset of tritium concentrations ($n=2410$) and tritium-helium groundwater ages ($n=1157$) from the California Central Valley, a large groundwater basin with complex land use, irrigation, and water management practices. The ML models were trained on $63$ features, including location, well construction information, landscape characteristics, and climate variables, water chemistry, and stable isotopes. The Bagging Regressor ML method can accurately classify (F1-score = $0.91$) groundwater samples as either modern or pre-modern whereas the accuracy of the ML prediction of continuous tritium-helium groundwater ages is limited and explains only $\\sim 30%$ of the variability in this dataset. In general, ML groundwater age prediction relies mostly on features related to (1) the source of groundwater recharge, (2) contaminant history, (3) aquifer materials, (4) well construction, and (5) geochemical reactions along flow paths.

Pose Estimation refers to the problem of localizing specific body parts in images and videos and encoding the spatial information into a caption relating human skeletal joints with pixel coordinates. While Pose Estimation models have largely been Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based, the advent of Vision Transformers (ViT) has opened new areas of research. In this study, we fine-tune a transformer-based model, BLIP, to generate accurate positional captions and explore attention mechanisms under this task. Starting with a low-complexity version of our problem, we scaled up to our task of fine-tuning BLIP for Pose Estimation. After fine-tuning BLIP on varying hyperparameters, we found that the model consistently performed well during tuning. Within a restricted threshold of 1 pixel, it retained an 81% validation accuracy and an average error of about 4 pixels.

Two feature extraction methods were explored: Eigenfaces and Fisherfaces. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were then trained using these features to classify faces accurately.\nDatasets Used: Olivetti Dataset: 400 images, 40 classes, 4096 features per image. Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW) Dataset: 1850 images, user-defined classes, 62500 features per image. Labelled Faces in the Wild (unprocessed) Dataset: 62500 features per image. Methodology: Feature Extraction: Eigenfaces: Utilized PCA to extract eigenfaces from the image datasets. Fisherfaces: Implemented Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) to extract discriminant features.\nClassification: SVMs with Linear and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels were trained using the extracted features.\nEvaluation: The performance of classifiers was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques such as t-SNE visualization were employed to analyze dataset distributions.\nKey Findings: Eigenfaces vs Fisherfaces: Fisherfaces showed improved classification performance compared to Eigenfaces, especially for complex datasets. SVM Kernel Comparison: Linear SVMs outperformed non-linear (RBF) SVMs for most datasets. Dataset Complexity: Performance varied based on dataset complexity, with higher accuracy achieved on simpler datasets. Impact of Dimensionality Reduction: Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA significantly influenced classifier performance. Conclusion: The project demonstrated the efficacy of Fisherfaces combined with SVMs for face recognition tasks.

Analyze the correlation between traffic congestion reduction and improvements in air quality, particularly regarding smog levels. Provide insights and recommendations based on data-driven findings to inform future policy decisions and urban planning initiatives.\nMethodology: Utilized the Google Maps Platform to extract data on travel times, routes, and congestion levels in Lahore. Conducted data preprocessing, including normalization of travel times and comparison of velocities to assess traffic congestion. Employed statistical analysis techniques to interpret the impact of school closures on traffic congestion before and during the winter break. Visualized findings through graphs, heatmaps, and geospatial mapping to facilitate understanding and communication of results.\nResults: Identified a significant decrease in traffic congestion on Mondays, particularly during the winter break when schools were closed. Observed a correlation between reduced traffic congestion and improvements in air quality, indicating the potential effectiveness of school closure policies in mitigating smog. Highlighted Thursdays as a day with the greatest decrease in congestion, suggesting alternative strategies beyond Mondays for reducing traffic congestion and smog.\nConclusion: This project sheds light on the efficacy of school closure policies in addressing traffic congestion and smog in Lahore. By providing actionable insights derived from data analysis, we intended to inform policymakers, urban planners, and stakeholders about effective strategies for mitigating the impact of smog in the region.
